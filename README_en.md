# AntiMakedingHosts

## Description

As we all know, more and more great applications now authorize CJMarketing to resell their software in China. CJMarketing is a famous copyright rogue which tampers the original software and crack them. They call their edited version of software the "official version".

I create this repository to help you figure out whether this domain belongs to the original software developer or CJMarketing, thus prevent us from buying fake software.

## How to use

I recommend you use [SwitchHosts](https://github.com/oldj/SwitchHosts) (Windows/macOS) or [Adaway](https://f-droid.org/app/org.adaway) (Android) to sync the hosts updates automatically.

The URL is: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skimige/AntiMakedingHosts/master/hosts`

Or you can visit [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Skimige/AntiMakedingHosts/master/hosts) and copy the content & paste it into your local hosts file.

## Notice

I don't really care about whether CJMarketing has got another authorization to sell their software, and it's launched another unofficial & fake website to force users to download their version.

In a word, this hosts **will not receive updates with CJMarketing's actions**. And if you find some domains owned by CJMarketing are not included, please kindly **raise an issue** or just **PR** them into this repo, thanks.
